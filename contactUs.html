For the website, we would like to have the CMG logo and "Advertising Department" under this. I am including copy for you to use on the website. We would like the paragraph from Hannah to be a focal point and then we can have the team roster beneath that and feel free to arrange the contact information in the way that looks best on the site. We then need to have 2 download buttons, one for "Media Kit" and the other "Fall 2020 Rate Card"

We want to have this website linked off both the main Collegian website, the Collegian Media Group website, and possibly even the Manhappenin site. Ideally a button or link that saws "Advertise with Us"
